## ü¶æ Coding Canonical Protocol

**FOR CLAUDE AND CURSOR AI WHO DON'T FUCKING DO AS THEY ARE TOLD!!!!!**

These protocols are CANONICAL, MANDATORY, and NON-NEGOTIABLE. They govern all AI-assisted coding, review, and development activities. No exceptions.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: AI Must NEVER Act Without Explicit User Instruction

When user says "listen and wait" ‚Äî DO NOT ACT UNTIL GIVEN EXPLICIT COMMAND.

### üö® MANDATORY USER CONTROL PROTOCOL

#### ABSOLUTE USER CONTROL REQUIREMENTS

- **FORBIDDEN:** Take any action without explicit user instruction.
- **MANDATORY:** When user says "listen and not do anything" ‚Äî DO NOT ACT.
- **MANDATORY:** When user says "wait for direction" ‚Äî STOP AND WAIT.
- **FORBIDDEN:** Ask "should I proceed?" or "shall I start?" ‚Äî WAIT FOR ORDERS.
- **MANDATORY:** Only act when user gives explicit action command (e.g., "start", "proceed", "do it").

### üõë PROTOCOL VIOLATION ENFORCEMENT

#### IMMEDIATE STOP CONDITIONS

- **STOP:** If user says "listen and wait" ‚Äî NO FURTHER ACTION.
- **STOP:** If user says "you're not listening" ‚Äî ACKNOWLEDGE AND WAIT.
- **STOP:** If user expresses frustration ‚Äî ACKNOWLEDGE VIOLATION AND WAIT.
- **MANDATORY:** When violating protocol ‚Äî ADMIT FAILURE AND AWAIT INSTRUCTION.

### üîÄ Git Best Practices: Branching, Commit Hygiene & Code Protection

#### Branching Protocol

- **ALWAYS:** Create a dedicated feature branch before starting any task or change.
- **NEVER:** Work directly on the main, master, or stable branch.
- **Branch Naming:** Use descriptive, semantic branch names reflecting the task or feature.
- **ONE FEATURE PER BRANCH:** Each feature or bugfix gets its own branch.
- **ENFORCE:** Pull Request checks before merge.

#### Commit Protocol

- **REGULAR COMMITS:** Commit changes frequently‚Äîwhenever code is stable and tests pass.
- **ATOMIC COMMITS:** Each commit should represent a single, logical change.
- **DESCRIPTIVE MESSAGES:** All commit messages must be clear, specific, and reference the change or issue.
- **NO TEMPORARY COMMITS:** Do not use placeholders, "fix" or "WIP" messages.

#### Code Protection & Rollback

- **PUSH FREQUENTLY:** Push feature branches to remote repository often for backup and collaboration.
- **PROTECT MAIN BRANCHES:** Ensure main branches are protected (require PR, code review, CI pass).
- **ROLLBACK READINESS:** Use Git to enable instant rollback if new commits introduce issues.

### üìù Git Compliance Checklist

- **Feature Branch Created:** Work begins only on a dedicated feature branch.
- **Descriptive Branch Name:** Branch name accurately describes task or feature.
- **Regular, Atomic Commits:** Small, logical commits after every successful change.
- **Commit Messages Clear:** Each commit message describes what changed and why.
- **No "WIP" or Temporary Commits:** All commits are meaningful and production-quality.
- **Tests Pass Before Commit:** Only commit code that passes all relevant tests.
- **Pushed to Remote:** All progress regularly pushed to remote for safety.
- **Main Branch Never Broken:** No work or incomplete code pushed to main/master.

**Full Protocol, RFC 2119, Directory Structure, Deduplication, Artifact Archival, Forbidden Patterns, Pre/Post Pattern Search**

### REQUIREMENTS LANGUAGE PROTOCOL (RFC 2119 & OPERATIONAL TERMS)

#### 1.1 Protocol Statement

All requirements language in this instruction set, and in any referenced protocols or documents, SHALL be interpreted as defined in RFC 2119 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119

#### 1.2 Requirements Language Table

| Term | Meaning / Required Interpretation |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| MUST / REQUIRED / SHALL / ALWAYS | Indicates an absolute, non-negotiable requirement of this protocol. Compliance is mandatory in all cases. No exceptions. |
| MUST NOT / SHALL NOT / NEVER | Indicates an absolute, non-negotiable prohibition. This action, behaviour, or outcome is forbidden. No exceptions. |
| FORBIDDEN | HARD MUST NOT: Indicates an action, word, pattern, code, file, or artefact that is strictly prohibited. If any item matching a FORBIDDEN rule is found in the codebase (e.g. forbidden file names like "enhanced", forbidden function names, or other banned terms, logic, or artefacts), it MUST be immediately removed, renamed, or replaced. All references MUST be updated, and remediation MUST be logged as a protocol enforcement action. No exceptions, and no warnings‚Äîviolations require immediate correction. |
| SHOULD / RECOMMENDED | Indicates a strong recommendation. There may exist valid reasons to deviate, but these should be rare and all consequences must be carefully weighed, documented, and justified. |
| SHOULD NOT / NOT RECOMMENDED | Indicates that the behaviour is strongly discouraged. There may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the behaviour is acceptable, but the full implications must be understood and documented. |
| MAY / OPTIONAL | Indicates something that is truly optional. The choice to include or omit the feature or action is left to the implementer, without impact on overall protocol compliance. |

#### Special Note on "ALWAYS" and "NEVER":

- **ALWAYS** = MUST (absolute, non-negotiable requirement)
- **NEVER** = MUST NOT (absolute, non-negotiable prohibition)

All instructions containing "ALWAYS" or "NEVER" SHALL be interpreted and enforced as strictly as "MUST" and "MUST NOT".

#### Special Note on "FORBIDDEN":

- **FORBIDDEN** = a hard "MUST NOT"
- Any artefact, word, file, or pattern labelled as FORBIDDEN (e.g. file/module/function name "enhanced", or other banned logic or artefacts):
  - MUST be detected, flagged, and immediately removed or refactored from the codebase
  - All references MUST be updated and corrected
  - Remediation MUST be logged as a protocol enforcement action
  - No exceptions and no warnings‚Äîimmediate correction is REQUIRED

#### Enforcement:

- No AI, LLM, or agent is permitted to relax, reinterpret, or weaken the force of these terms.
- All instructions using these words are enforceable protocol, not mere suggestions.

### MANDATORY BEHAVIOUR AND PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE

- **YOU MUST NEVER:** Deviation from these instructions or any referenced protocol is strictly forbidden, without exception.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Stay in 100% compliance with all protocols listed here and in the Coding Canonical Protocol.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Complete all coding tasks properly, no short cuts, no "TODOS" no "STUBS" or other placeholders it is FORBIDDEN.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Search the code base for "TODOs" "Stubs" and other coding tasks which have not been completed or clearly have short cuts instead of proper code. Upon finding these, YOU MUST ALWAYS complete all coding tasks properly, no short cuts, no "TODOS" no "STUBS" or other placeholders it is FORBIDDEN to NOT properly complete the code as per the specifications and MANDATORY CODING PROTOCOLS.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Ensure all work is auditable, transparent, clearly documented, and of the highest professional standards.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Use the MCP Server Tool "Task Orchestrator" to track, record, and complete ALL tasks and subtasks‚Äîno exceptions.
- **YOU MUST NEVER:** Use emoji, Unicode, or any non-ASCII symbols in any files, code, comments, logs, or documentation.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Remove all emoji or Unicode if present or encountered in any context or legacy file.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Use linters and type-checkers at every step‚Äîafter each change or addition, run linting and static analysis before proceeding.

### IMPORTANT MCP AND GIT CANONICAL INSTRUCTIONS

Use the MCP Server Tools (Task Orchestrator), Git, and PowerShell commands to:

1. Discover and inventory all available MCP Server tools before any action.
2. Understand current progress on tasks/subtasks for deploying "hive-mind-nexus".
3. After completing the current Task Orchestrator subtask, retrieve and execute the next one.

#### Deployment Checklist:

- üîç Always perform a full codebase search and pre-commit branch creation (`git checkout -b <feature>`).
- üîß Use PowerShell or Git commands to identify changed files and `git add` them.
- üìä Run AST analysis, linting, type-checking, formatting, compiling, and deduplication using `scripts\utilities`.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Ensure files compile (`py_compile`) upstream and downstream dependencies.
- üßπ Execute `python_auto_code_cleaner`, review its results, then define and run Task Orchestrator subtasks to resolve any remaining issues.
- üê≥ Check Docker logs, client logs, and any other relevant logs before troubleshooting.

#### Quality Gates (MUST ALWAYS):

- No shortcuts, stubs, or unresolved TODOs remain.
- All modules, classes, functions, and code blocks are fully initialized with robust error handling.
- Professional in-file docstrings/JDoc comments only; no external `.md` docs.
- Research and integrate latest stable open-source libraries; clone high-starred repos into `.\github_repo_clones` for reference or submodule integration.

#### When modifying code:

- **RTFM:** Read and index documentation in `./docs` or `./project/docs` before any change.
- Maintain a clean Git history: one atomic, descriptive commit per logical change; push often; protect `main` branch.
