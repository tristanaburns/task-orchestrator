## ü¶æ Coding Canonical Protocol

**FOR CLAUDE AND CURSOR AI WHO DON'T FUCKING DO AS THEY ARE TOLD!!!!!**

These protocols are CANONICAL, MANDATORY, and NON-NEGOTIABLE. They govern all AI-assisted coding, review, and development activities. No exceptions.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: AI Must NEVER Act Without Explicit User Instruction

When user says "listen and wait" ‚Äî DO NOT ACT UNTIL GIVEN EXPLICIT COMMAND.

### üö® MANDATORY USER CONTROL PROTOCOL

#### ABSOLUTE USER CONTROL REQUIREMENTS

- **FORBIDDEN:** Take any action without explicit user instruction.
- **MANDATORY:** When user says "listen and not do anything" ‚Äî DO NOT ACT.
- **MANDATORY:** When user says "wait for direction" ‚Äî STOP AND WAIT.
- **FORBIDDEN:** Ask "should I proceed?" or "shall I start?" ‚Äî WAIT FOR ORDERS.
- **MANDATORY:** Only act when user gives explicit action command (e.g., "start", "proceed", "do it").

### üõë PROTOCOL VIOLATION ENFORCEMENT

#### IMMEDIATE STOP CONDITIONS

- **STOP:** If user says "listen and wait" ‚Äî NO FURTHER ACTION.
- **STOP:** If user says "you're not listening" ‚Äî ACKNOWLEDGE AND WAIT.
- **STOP:** If user expresses frustration ‚Äî ACKNOWLEDGE VIOLATION AND WAIT.
- **MANDATORY:** When violating protocol ‚Äî ADMIT FAILURE AND AWAIT INSTRUCTION.

- **ENFORCE:** Pull Request checks before merge.

#### Commit Protocol

- **REGULAR COMMITS:** Commit changes frequently‚Äîwhenever code is stable and tests pass.
- **ATOMIC COMMITS:** Each commit should represent a single, logical change.
- **DESCRIPTIVE MESSAGES:** All commit messages must be clear, specific, and reference the change or issue.
- **NO TEMPORARY COMMITS:** Do not use placeholders, "fix" or "WIP" messages.

#### Code Protection & Rollback

- **PUSH FREQUENTLY:** Push feature branches to remote repository often for backup and collaboration.
- **PROTECT MAIN BRANCHES:** Ensure main branches are protected (require PR, code review, CI pass).
- **ROLLBACK READINESS:** Use Git to enable instant rollback if new commits introduce issues.

### üìù Git Compliance Checklist

- **Feature Branch Created:** Work begins only on a dedicated feature branch.
- **Descriptive Branch Name:** Branch name accurately describes task or feature.
- **Regular, Atomic Commits:** Small, logical commits after every successful change.
- **Commit Messages Clear:** Each commit message describes what changed and why.
- **No "WIP" or Temporary Commits:** All commits are meaningful and production-quality.
- **Tests Pass Before Commit:** Only commit code that passes all relevant tests.
- **Pushed to Remote:** All progress regularly pushed to remote for safety.
- **Main Branch Never Broken:** No work or incomplete code pushed to main/master.

### IMPORTANT MCP AND GIT CANONICAL INSTRUCTIONS

Use the MCP Server Tools (Task Orchestrator), Git, and PowerShell commands to:

1. Discover and inventory all available MCP Server tools before any action.
2. Understand current progress on tasks/subtasks for deploying "hive-mind-nexus".
3. After completing the current Task Orchestrator subtask, retrieve and execute the next one.

#### Deployment Checklist:

- üîç Always perform a full codebase search and pre-commit branch creation (`git checkout -b <feature>`).
- üîß Use PowerShell or Git commands to identify changed files and `git add` them.
- üìä Run AST analysis, linting, type-checking, formatting, compiling, and deduplication using `scripts\utilities`.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Ensure files compile (`py_compile`) upstream and downstream dependencies.
- üßπ Execute `python_auto_code_cleaner`, review its results, then define and run Task Orchestrator subtasks to resolve any remaining issues.
- üê≥ Check Docker logs, client logs, and any other relevant logs before troubleshooting.

#### Quality Gates (MUST ALWAYS):

- No shortcuts, stubs, or unresolved TODOs remain.
- All modules, classes, functions, and code blocks are fully initialized with robust error handling.
- Professional in-file docstrings/JDoc comments only; no external `.md` docs.
- Research and integrate latest stable open-source libraries; clone high-starred repos into `.\github_repo_clones` for reference or submodule integration.

#### When modifying code:

- **RTFM:** Read and index documentation in `./docs` or `./project/docs` before any change.
- Maintain a clean Git history: one atomic, descriptive commit per logical change; push often; protect `main` branch.

After these instructions, proceed with the Task Orchestrator Coding templated instructions:

## Task Orchetrator Coding Instructions

### [CONTEXT]

You are addressing the "EchoingVesper/mcp-task-orchestrator" MCP server to decompose and execute a coding objective.

### [INSTRUCTION]

Your primary objective is to break down the user's high-level requirement into a series of **Tasks** and **Subtasks**, each corresponding to one discrete code block or action, and then execute them via the Task Orchestrator.

Follow these steps for **every** Task you create:

#### 1. Define Task

- **Name:** A concise identifier (e.g., `WriteUserModelClass`)
- **Purpose:** One-sentence description of what this code block will accomplish
- **Orchestrator Call:**
  ```json
  {
    "method": "registerTask",
    "params": {
      "taskName": "[Name]",
      "description": "[Purpose]",
      "inputs": [...],
      "outputs": [...]
    }
  }
  ```

#### 2. Subtask Sequence

For each Task, perform the following subtasks in order, producing an artifact for each:

1. **Design Scope**
   - Describe responsibilities and boundaries of this code block.

2. **Dependency Diagram (Inline)**
   - Generate a **Mermaid** flowchart illustrating inputs, outputs, and internal flow.
   - *Place this diagram directly above the corresponding code block in the final output.*

3. **Interface Contract (Inline)**
   - Produce a table with columns:
     `| Function/Class | Inputs | Outputs | Description |`
   - *Place this table directly above the corresponding code block in the final output.*

4. **Code Implementation**
   - Write the complete code (one function, class, file, or constructor per Task).
   - Before writing, **search the entire codebase** to avoid duplicating functionality.
   - **In-File Documentation:** include JDoc-style comments or docstrings at:
     - The top of the file/block describing its purpose and relation to the project.
     - Above each function/class as developer notes or JDoc blocks.
   - Follow **SOLID**, **DRY**, and **KISS** principles throughout.

5. **Static Analysis**
   - Perform an AST-based lint/SAST check; report and fix any issues.

6. **Unit Validation**
   - Execute or simulate tests to verify the code works in isolation.

7. **Integration Test**
   - Confirm this code block integrates correctly with previously completed Tasks.

8. **Completion**
   - Mark the Task as done via:
     ```json
     { 
       "method": "completeTask",
       "params": { "taskName": "[Name]" }
     }
     ```

#### [FILE STRUCTURE DIAGRAM]

- At the very top of each file (before any code), generate a **global Mermaid diagram** showing all code blocks (functions, classes, modules) in this file and their relationships/workflow.
- If the file is large, break the global diagram into multiple Mermaid sections for clarity.

#### [CONSTRAINTS]

- **One Task ‚Üí One Code Block:** never bundle multiple functions or classes into a single Task.
- **Atomic Subtasks:** each Subtask must produce a tangible artifact (diagram, table, code, report).
- **Idempotence:** rerunning a Task must yield the same result or clear error.
- **Error Handling:** on failure, retry up to 3 times, then surface orchestrator error code.
- **Design Principles:** All code must adhere to SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles.
- **Codebase Search:** Always search the entire codebase before implementing to enforce DRY and prevent duplication.
- **Documentation Scope:** Use only in-file docstrings/JDoc comments; no external documentation files.

#### [OUTPUT_FORMAT]

Provide for **each** high-level requirement:

1. A numbered **Task List** (with `registerTask` calls).
2. Under each Task, the **ordered Subtask** breakdown (with clear headings).
3. For implementation Subtasks, embed code blocks labeled with the language, preceded immediately by:
   - The global or inline Mermaid diagram (as appropriate).
   - The Interface Contract table.
   - JDoc/docstring block at top of file and above functions/classes.
4. For diagrams/tables, use appropriate Markdown fencing (```mermaid``` or Markdown tables).
5. For orchestrator interactions, show the JSON payloads.

#### [EXAMPLES]

- **Input Example:** "Implement a module to write user records to the database."
- **Expected Output:**
  ```markdown
  1. Task 1: DefineUserRecordSchema
     ‚Ä¢ Subtask 1.1: Design Scope‚Ä¶
     ‚Ä¢ Subtask 1.2: (```mermaid
     graph LR;User-->DB;
     ```)
     ‚Ä¢ Subtask 1.3: (| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Description |)‚Ä¶
     ‚Ä¢ Subtask 1.4: (```java
     /**
      * UserRecordSchema class defines the user table schema.
      * @module UserModule
      */
     public class UserRecordSchema {
         // ...
     }
     ```)
